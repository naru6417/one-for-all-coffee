    comment: `Great first visit at One For All. Love the slogan as 
    I\u2019m a huge fan of the literary classics. By far a great selection of beans 
    for Espresso. Flavourful, Balanced, and just great Body and Finish at every 
    sip. I had an Oat Milk Flat White that was not shy to let the great 
    tasting intensity come through. Medium Roasts have changed my mind and
    One For All definitely has a great recipe on-hand. Looking forward to
    my next visit, since I can confidently say there\u2019s good coffee in the core. Kudos.`,

    comment: `Quickly becoming my favourite cafe in Hamilton! I\u2019ve been to this
    place a couple of times now, and been wowed both times with my order, the vibes
    of this place, and also the incredible service. I have tried the Americano 
    (stellar) and also the hot chocolate (amongst the best I have ever had), the 
    cookie I tried was also very flavourful. Highly recommend for an upscale coffee experience`

    comment: `Wow! This coffee is unbelievable! Hands down one of the best lattes I\u2019ve had (ever). 
    I need to go back and try the pour over coffee. The cafe itself is super aesthetic, only has a 
    few tables for two. The barista was super friendly and I could see he really took time with 
    every order. 100% recommend if you want good coffee!`

    Best coffee I've had in a long time. And the art on the cup is so cute!

    comment: `This coffee shop is truly in a league of its own, combining 
    stunning decor with exceptional coffee that\u2019s worth every penny. From the 
    moment we walked in, we felt transported to a serene and calming space—a 
    perfect escape to enjoy a cup of coffee. We ordered the matcha and hojicha lattes, 
    and both were incredible! Unlike other places where we\u2019re tempted to add sugar 
    to mask bitterness, these lattes delivered rich, creamy flavors from the very first sip. 
    Every element felt perfectly balanced and indulgent. The staff were warm, friendly, 
    and made the experience even better. Do NOT miss out on this gem—it\u2019s the kind of place 
    that leaves you feeling amazing after just one cup. Treat yourself and stop by today!`

    comment: `Highly recommend Peanut Cloud. The coffee and corn cookie are the perfect 
    combination, not too sweet. Thanks for the recommendation. The atmosphere in the 
    store is also very good. I will go there again when I free.`
